# Classroom Key and Bicycle Management System

## Project Overview
This project is an online platform designed to efficiently manage the distribution of classroom keys and bicycles within an institution. The system ensures that only Class Representatives (CRs) have access to classroom keys, while both CRs and non-CRs can manage bicycle access.

## Features
### **Classroom Key Management**
- **CR-Only Access**: Only CRs have the authority to request and handle classroom keys.
- **Key Request**: A CR can request a key from another CR if necessary.
- **Key Tracking**: The system records key handovers to maintain accountability.

### **Bicycle Management**
- **Open Access**: Both CRs and non-CRs can manage bicycles.
- **Bicycle Availability**: Users can check available bicycles.
- **Bicycle Management**: Users can view and track bicycles but cannot request them.
